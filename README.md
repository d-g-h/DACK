[Homebrew](http://brew.sh)
[Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com)
[Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org)

Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)

Install via Ansible >= 1.9.2 via homebrew
```sh
brew update
brew install ansible
```

Install Virtualbox and Vagrant (brew-cask is an optional here, or simple head to the links above)

<sub>Vagrant >= 1.7.4, Virtualbox >= 5.0.0</sub>

```sh
git clone https://github.com/d-g-h/DACK.git {{PROJECT_NAME}}
```

For example,
```sh
git clone https://github.com/d-g-h/DACK.git DEVTESTPHP
```

## Configuration

Adjust your /etc/hosts file as necessary to match the [Vagrantfile](https://github.com/RadishLab/STACK/blob/master/Vagrantfile)

```
192.168.50.254
```

For example,
```hosts
192.168.50.254 dev.dev
```

Change the `PROJECT_NAME`

In {{PROJECT_NAME}}/group_vars/all.yml

```
project_name: "dev"
project_url: "dev.dev"
```

**Start** the server with `vagrant up`
If `vagrant up` outputs an error, please run `vagrant destroy -f`. Then save and remove the project folder.

**Stop** the server with `vagrant halt`

**Resume** the server with `vagrant up`

### MySQL
`mysql -u root -proot`
Once the box is running you might want to use Sequel Pro.
You can use the default set port 2254 but you should increment an unique port number (host) to avoid the problems below in Vagrantfile.

```
config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 22, host: 2254, auto_correct: false, id: "ssh"
```

You might run into the error below which means that you have a conflict with your `~/.ssh/known_hosts`
